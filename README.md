### Description

GameRecap is a web-based game archive application designed to provide users with a way
to keep track of their video game experiences. With GameRecap, users can create profiles, add
games to their playlists, discover new games through other usersâ€™ playlists, share their thoughts
and opinions on games with the community, and view the insights and opinions of others. During
its development phase, the application has implemented the features outlined in the first section,
as well as an admin panel. GameRecap utilizes the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and
Node.js) tech stack and PostgreSQL as its database management system. The following sections
will provide further detail on the features implemented in the application. Detailed project description
and screenshots can be seen in the project report.

### Description

GameRecap is a web-based game archive that helps users keep track of their video games. The platform allows users to create an account, where they can store information on game genres, platforms, and regions. Additionally, it displays information on downloadable content and reviews. GameRecap also allows users to keep track of their own reviews and log the games they have played. Users can discover new releases, popular games, and more through playlists made by other users, based on their personal preferences. The platform provides detailed information about a game, such as the languages it supports, number of players, synopsis, developer and publisher, and links to merchandise related to the game. Furthermore, it also provides information on the game's availability on the user's platform of choice and if the game is offered through a subscription service. GameRecap gives users the necessary information to decide whether or not to spend their money and time on a particular game. GameRecap utilizes the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js) tech stack and PostgreSQL as its database management system. Detailed project description
and screenshots can be seen in the project report.
